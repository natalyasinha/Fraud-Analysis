# Fraud-Analysis

Objective of Project

The main objective of the project is to develop a supervised model that can detect cases of fraud in a dataset of credit card transactions. 
We analyze a given data that we clean by replacing missing values and zeroes. Once the data is clean, we then create a list of expert 
variables that will be used as part of developing several models in which we compare them with each other so that we can decide which 
of them gives the best results in detecting fraud cases. We also produced fraud scores to determine where in the data are frauds most
occurring and how severe the frauds are. Finally, we will give recommendations on what actions to take after getting the results.

Assumptions

(1) The audience that this report is directed to has sufficient knowledge of data science to understand the project and 
to reproduce the results of our models.
(2) Because we are using a supervised model, the results will determine actual cases of fraud based on fraud scores.
